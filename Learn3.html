									<p>The game has been fully developed fot the most part and is in a playable state! The testing phase is when the team sends the game out to friends, family and other testers to let them play the game and receive feedback on it. Are there any bugs or glitches they missed? Is a gameplay mechanic too hard, or too easy? Are thigns explained well? Is it fun? Is it boring? 
                                      <br><br>
                                    All of these questions are answered by the testers. The team takes this feedback and makes any final changes to the game over the final weeks before they can call their game completed. Once testing is over, it's time to get the game out to the public! </p>

									<p>The game is completed! It's finally finished and the team is proud of their outstanding work. It's been a journey filled with ups and downs, but they've persevered and completed an amazing piece of work. Now comes the time to <Strong>Deploy</Strong> the game, which is the process of getting it out on the market. <br><br>
                                      
                                    Deployment comes in many forms, depending on the desired platform and audience. Some examples for where to deploy a game are <Strong>Computers, Tablets, Phones, or Gaming Consoles.</Strong> <br><br> 
                                  
                                    Each platform is important to the gaming scene, and the platform determines how the deployment occurs. For Computers, Steam and itch.io are famous places to host and games. For Tablets and Phones, the Appstore or Playstore are the only placed to host gaming apps. For consoles, it requires a partnership with a company who allows the team to place their game on the gaming network of their choice.</p>
